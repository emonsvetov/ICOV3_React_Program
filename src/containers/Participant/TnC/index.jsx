                            the event Company is required to make payment to Client as a result of the reconciliation
                            set forth in any invoice. Should either party fail to make any monthly installment payment
                            or final payment required by Section 9(c) within five (5) days of the due date therefore,
                            such payment will accrue interest at a rate of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month, or

                            its financial and other obligations under this and the other Party shall have the right, at
                            its own expense, to examine such books at all reasonable times (but no more than once per
                            calendar year) for the purpose of verifying compliance with the terms hereto.<br />

                            to, but did not receive a Code or Codes, or has encountered difficulty in using the Code for
                            a purchase from a Commerce Partner, Company will respond to the claim and assist in
                            resolving the claim with the appropriate Commerce Partner. Because Client is solely
                            responsible for, and has complete control over, the identification of Recipients eligible
                            for participation in the Service as well as the awarding of Grants to Recipients, Client
                            understands and acknowledges that it bears all risk of loss occasioned by fraudulent or
                            erroneous identification of eligible Recipients as well as Grants and Codes issued as a
                            result thereof and that Company cannot be held be responsible or liable therefor.<br />

                            remit such taxes as may be imposed with respect to any compensation, royalties or
                            transactions under this Agreement. Each Party represents and warrants that (a) its website

                            indemnifying party diligently defends such claim and (ii) that the indemnifying party may
                            not settle the claim without the prior written consent (which consent will not be
                            unreasonably withheld or delayed) of the Party to be indemnified, and (d) may, at its
                            expense, participate in the defense and settlement of the claim.<br />

                        <p>(a) Client Use of Company's Marks. Client understands and agrees that all Client marketing
                            efforts which bear Company's name or any of Company's Marks or which refer to the Service
                            (including the Service) are subject to review and approval by Company. Company agrees that
                            it will review all such Client marketing materials in a timely fashion and shall notify
                            Client in writing of the results of such review within five (5) business days of receipt of
                            such materials. Company agrees that approval of the marketing materials shall not be
                            unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that Company fails to
                            provide such written notice within five (5) business days of receipt by Company, Company
                            agrees that such failure shall constitute an approval by Company. After Company approves any
                            Client marketing materials, Client may reuse the Client marketing materials without need for
                            further submission and approval, unless otherwise specifically stated in writing by Company
                            at the time of the initial approval or thereafter.<br />
                        </p>
                        <p>(b) Company Use of Client's Marks. Except to the extent set forth below, Company understands
                            and agrees that all Company marketing efforts which bear Client's name or any of Client's
                            Marks or which specifically promote the use of the Service are subject to review and
                            approval by Client. Client agrees that it will review all such Company marketing materials
                            in a timely fashion and shall notify Company in writing of the results of such review within
                            five (5) business days of receipt of such materials. Client agrees that approval of the
                            marketing materials shall not be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
                            the event that Client fails to provide such written notice within five (5) business days of
                            receipt by Client, Client agrees that such failure shall constitute an approval by Client.
                            Once Client approves any Company marketing materials, Company may reuse the Company
                            marketing materials without need for further submission and approval, unless otherwise
                            specifically stated in writing by Client at the time of the initial approval or thereafter.
                            In addition to the foregoing and notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
                            Client agrees that Company may reuse previously approved copy that includes Client's name or
                            Client's Marks or that specifically promotes use of the Service in other Company marketing
                            and/or promotional materials on the Company website and in Company promotional emails and
                            direct mail pieces without the need for further submission and approval.<br />
                        </p>
                        <p>(c) Continuance of Use. Upon termination of the CRA, neither Party shall produce any new
                            marketing materials that include the other Party's name; provided, however, that the Parties
                            may continue to use and distribute existing printed marketing materials that include the
                            other Party's name, any of Company's Mark or Client's Marks or which specifically promote
                            the Service until the inventory of such marketing materials is depleted. In no event shall
                            either party's previously prepared marketing materials be used more than six (6) months
                            after the CRA is terminated.<br />
                        </p>
                        <p>(d) Use Restrictions. Company and Client shall not use the other Party's Marks in a manner
                            that (a) disparages the other Party or its products or services, (b) portrays the other
                            Party or its products or services in a false, competitively adverse or poor light; or (c)
                            diminishes the value of the other Party's Marks. If Company or Client is not complying with
                            such use restrictions in the sole discretion of the other Party, Company or Client shall
                            immediately comply with the other Party's requests as to the use of the other Party's Marks.<br />
                        </p>
                        <p>(e) Improper Uses. Except as contemplated by the CRA, a Party shall not: (a) register any
                            domain name which incorporates the other Party's Marks, unless otherwise agreed to by that
                            Party (and the Party seeking to register the domain name hereby agrees to transfer such
                            domain name to the other Party if it breaches this provision); (b) register any of the other
                            Party's Marks or any trademarks or service marks that are confusingly similar to any of that
                            Party's Marks, unless otherwise agreed to by the Party that owns the Marks; (c) use the
                            other Party's name or Marks as part of its corporate name, (d) modify or alter the other
                            Party's website in any way; or (e) make any representations, either express or implied, or
                            create an appearance that a visitor to the other Party's website is visiting its site,
                            without the other Party's prior written approval.<br />

                                (a) Protection of Confidential Information. Neither Party will use, disclose, or grant
                                use of the other Party's Confidential Information except as expressly authorized by the
                                CRA. Each Party agrees that the Confidential Information of the other Party will be held
                                in confidence at least to the same extent and the same manner as each Party protects its
                                own Confidential Information, but each Party agrees that in no event will less than
                                reasonable care be used to protect the other Party's Confidential Information. For
                                purposes of this Agreement, "Confidential Information" means, except as otherwise
                                specifically provided for herein, each Party's trade secrets and any confidential or
                                other proprietary information, whether of a technical, business or other nature, that is
                                of value to the owner of such information and is treated as confidential (including,
                                without limitation, with respect to Company, information regarding discounts received by
                                Company for the purchase of Codes from its Commerce Partners).<br />
                        </p>
                        <p>(b) Exceptions. Either Party may disclose Confidential Information to its employees, agents
                            and/or contractors who need to know such information for the purposes of fulfilling their
                            obligations for or on behalf of such Party.</p>
                        <p><br />
                            (c) Equitable Relief. The receiving Party acknowledges and agrees that due to the unique
                            nature of the disclosing Party's Confidential Information, there can be no adequate remedy
                            at law for any breach of its obligations hereunder, that any such breach may allow the
                            receiving Party or third parties to unfairly compete with the disclosing Party, resulting in
                            irreparable harm to the disclosing Party, and therefore, that upon any such breach or any
                            threat thereof, the disclosing Party may be entitled to appropriate equitable relief,
                            without the requirement of posting a bond, in addition to whatever remedies it might have at
                            law.<br />

                            inconvenience to Recipients is kept to a minimum. In particular, the Parties agree that they
                            will jointly agree on timing and content of any notices sent to Recipients. In the event
                            that either Party terminates this Agreement because of a breach by the other Party, the
                            breaching Party shall bear all costs of notifying Recipients of the termination of this
                            Agreement. In all other instances, the Parties shall jointly bear the cost of notifying
                            Recipients of termination of this Agreement.</p>
                        <p><br />

                            Company will render a final invoice and the Party responsible for payment as shown on such
                            invoice will pay to the other Party the amount owing within ten (10) days of the invoice
                            date. All Recipient Grants will expire upon termination of this Agreement.</p>

                            OUT OF THIS THE CRA AND THESE TERMS &amp; CONDITIONS (EXCEPT FOR LIABILITIES ARISING OUT OF

                            in connection with all disputes, controversies or claims, whether based on contract, tort,
                            statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, except as otherwise provided in
                            this Section, arising out or relating to the CRA or these Terms &amp; Conditions or the
                            breach or alleged breach hereof (collectively, "Disputes"). The Parties will attempt to
                            settle all Disputes through good faith negotiations. If those attempts fail to resolve the
                            Dispute within forty-five (45) days of the date of initial demand for negotiation, then the
                            Dispute shall be determined and settled by arbitration in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida
                            administered by and pursuant to the rules then in effect of the American Arbitration
                            Association, and each party hereby consents to the jurisdiction thereof. Any award rendered
                            shall be final and conclusive upon the Parties and a judgment thereon may be entered in a
                            court having competent jurisdiction. All costs and expenses, including any attorney's fees,
                            of the Parties incurred in any Dispute shall be borne by the Party that is determined to be
                            liable in respect of such Dispute; provided, however, that if complete liability is not
                            assessed against any one Party, the Parties shall share the total costs in proportion to
                            their respective amounts of liability as determined by the arbitrator. Except where clearly
                            prevented by the area in Dispute, both Parties agree to continue performing their respective
                            obligations under this Agreement while the Dispute is being resolved.</p>

                            (f) Assignment. Neither Party may assign its rights under the CRA, in whole or in part,
                            without the other Party's prior written consent (which will not be withheld unreasonably or
                            delayed), except such consent shall not be required with respect to assignments to: (i) any
                            Affiliate of the assigning Party; (ii) any entity resulting from any merger, consolidation,

                            (g) Commercially Reasonable Delays; Force Majeure. Neither Company nor Client will be liable
                            for, or will be considered to be in breach of or default hereunder on account of, any delay
                            or failure to perform as required hereunder (other than payment obligations) as a result of
                            any causes or conditions that are beyond such Party's reasonable control and that such Party
                            is unable to overcome through the exercise of commercially reasonable diligence. If any
                            force majeure event occurs, the affected Party will give prompt written notice to the other
                            Party and will use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the impact of the event.</p>

                            (h) Consents; Waiver. The failure of a Party hereto at any time or times to require
                            performance of any provision hereof shall in no manner affect its right at a later time to
                            enforce the same unless the same is waived in writing. No waiver by a Party of any condition
                            or breach of any term, covenant, representation or warranty contained shall be effective
                            unless in writing, and no waiver of any one or more instances shall be deemed to be a
                            further or continuing waiver of any such condition or breach in other instances or a waiver
                            of any other condition or breach of any other term, covenant, representation or warranty.
